A question comes on screen saying what would you do in this situation. The options are: 1. Say Oh, I didn't mean to hurt you, so stop making such a big deal about it. 2. Say, I have a friend who likes having coffee spilt on her, so I'm sure you must be fine. 3. Say, I'm really sorry. Are you okay? How can I help? Let me get some napkins. After that the following text comes up on screen. Most people would choose number 3. When you said you were sorry and offered to help, you focused on your impact on the other person instead of on your intent. The same applies when you unintentionally offend someone in another way, such as through a microaggression."
