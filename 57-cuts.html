The first cut is irritating but can often be dealt with easily. Then a girl is waving swords around and on screen it says. It is the repeated cuts throughout the day and the week that becomes too much to bear. Psychologists refer to the impact of microaggressions over time as death by a thousand cuts. That is the impact that research says it has on individuals. Imagine a day of hearing: You are the least scary black guy I have ever met. Maybe you should pick an easier career than medicine? Can I touch your hair? After experiencing a lot of microaggressions, would you not want to blow? But what is the reaction you get if you blow? Watch out; there is another oversensitive angry black person."
